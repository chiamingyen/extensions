      CM Sans Serif boldface fonts. The EC (T1, Cork) encoded
      versions of the `CM Sans Serif boldface extended' fonts differ
      considerably from the traditionally (OT1) encoded ones: At
      large sizes, &gt; 10pt, they have thinner strokes and are much
      wider. At 25pt they are hardly to be recognized as being
      `boldface'. This package attempts to make these T1 fonts
      look like the traditional ones did. You do not need any new
      fonts; the package just changes the way LaTeX makes use of
      the current ones.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="3257">texmf\tex\latex\cmsd\cmsd.sty texmf\tex\latex\cmsd\t1cmsd.fd texmf\tex\latex\cmsd\ts1cmsd.fd texmf\tpm\packages\cmsd.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="4801">texmf\source\latex\cmsd\liesmich texmf\source\latex\cmsd\readme</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>989864094</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>c6f42d55b9e32b1cbdb118e585315787</TPM:MD5></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
