IMPORTANT NOTE:
     
These fonts make use of the 256-character capabilities of gf
format. They cannot be converted to the obsolete PXL format which
allows only 128 characters. If you are still using PXL format
drivers, it is time to convert. If you are using a gf format
driver with only 128 character capacity, you are missing
something. See doc/install.tex.
     
Metafont must have |max_in_open| increased (to 10) to compile
these fonts as they stand. The appropriate change has been added
to the change files on the UnixTeX distribution. If you're
getting these fonts other than from the TeX distribution, and if
you don't have access to Metafont source, you'll have to merge
some files before you attempt compilation:
     
   In src/s.mf, replace the line readfrom("gen_sigma") by the
     contents of src/gen_sigma.mf.
   In src/lower.mf, replace each line by the contents of the
     corresponding file; for instance, replace readfrom("a") by
     the contents of src/a.mf.
   In greek.mf, right after the line that says ``font_setup''
     insert the lines
     
   readfrom("gen_acc");
   readfrom("gen_sigma");

HMC:
At HMC a couple of modifications have been made to the MF files:
   
   The definition of readfrom has been changed so that no
     directory information is present.
   accent.mf has been renamed graccent.mf and punct.mf has been
     renamed grpunct.mf to prevent conflicts with CM files.

 TODO:
create digamma
add kerning, especially between accents and capitals
create more typefaces (italics?)
complete hyphenation table
create tick marks for numbers
