This is the README file for the 'catoptions' package.

VERSION

Version 0.2.7b, 2011/12/17

SUMMARY

The 'catoptions' package changes package loading internals so
that all subsequently loaded packages can rely on normal/standard
catcodes of all ASCII characters. The package defines canonical
control sequences to represent all the visible ASCII characters.
It also provides robust options parsing mechanisms, in addition
to many TeX programming tools.
