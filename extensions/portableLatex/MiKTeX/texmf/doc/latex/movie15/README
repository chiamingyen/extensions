Description:

    *
    * Note:
    * This package is obsolete now. Consider using package `media9'.
    *

    This package provides an interface to embed movies, sounds and 3D objects
    into PDF documents for use with LaTeX as well as pdfLaTeX. It follows the
    PDF-1.5 and PDF-1.6 specifications for embedding multimedia content. The
    specification allows media file data to be completely incorporated into the
    PDF output, thus producing self-contained PDF documents. A number of file
    formats is supported. For a (possibly incomplete) list see the table at the
    end of this file or refer to the PDF specification:

        PDF Reference, fifth edition:
        Adobe Portable Document Format version 1.6,
        Implementation note 144, Appendix H.3,

    available somewhere on Adobe's web site (http://www.adobe.com).

    Note, this file only gives a summary of usage and available command
    options. Please refer to the documentation `movie15.pdf' in the `doc/'
    directory for details and examples.

Usage:

 \usepackage[<package options>]{movie15}

   Package option `3D' enables the 3D feature from the PDF-1.6 specification.
   With option `draft' media files are not included. Instead, the file name
   is printed in a box of size <width>x(<height>+<depth>). `final' does the
   opposite, overriding a global draft option specified in the \documentclass
   command.


 \includemovie[<options>]{<width>}{<height>}{<media file>}

   <width> and <height> in TeX dimensions, may be left empty, see option `text'

   <media file> file name of the media clip


 \movieref[<options>]{<label spec>}{<text>}

   makes <text> a hyperlink to the embedded media file which has been labelled
   with <label spec> using the `label' option of the inclusion command.

   Provides a means to control the playback state and properties of the
   referenced media. In 3D context, it can be used to define an additional view
   of the object, to access a particular view from the list of predefined views
   by index or to run a JavaScript. Moreover, links can be created for
   calculating 3D camera settings.

   In addition to `play' (default), `stop', `resume', `pause', `close',
   `3Dviewindex', `3Dcalculate' and `3Dgetview' it accepts `controls', `repeat',
   `palindrome', `startat', `endat', `mouse', `rate', `volume', `default',
   `3Dcoo', '3Droll', `3Dc2c', `3Droo', `3Dcaa' and `3Djscript' from the
   subsequent list of command options.


 Options:

   attach[=false]             By default, the embedded data stream is re-used as
                              embedded file attachment, giving the user the
                              opportunity to extract the media file and to save
                              it to disk for later playback with an external
                              player.  Re-use as file attachment can be
                              suppressed with `attach=false'.

   autoclose                  Close the media player when the page is closed.
                              Use of this option may be necessary for streamed
                              media, such as Real Video.

   autopause                  Pause playback when page is closed.

   autoplay                   Start playback when page is opened. Useful for
                              side by side movies to be played back
                              simultaneously.

   autostop                   Stops playing but keeps the media loaded when the
                              page is closed. The media is rewound to its
                              beginning or its `startat' position. This option
                              is set by default if neither of the options
                              `autopause', `autoclose' or `continue' is set.

   autoresume                 Resume previously paused playback when page
                              is opened.

   continue                   Continue playback in background on premature page
                              change.

   controls[=true|false]      Display player specific controls.

   depth=<depth>              Specifies how far the media display area should
                              extend below the reference line of the running
                              text. Any valid TeX dimension will be accepted.

   draft                      Locally switches to draft mode.

   externalviewer             Opens and plays the media in an external
                              application.

   final                      Locally disables draft mode.

   inline[=false]             Movie file data are embedded into the PDF output
                              by default. Embedding can be suppressed using
                              `inline=false'.

   label=<label spec>         The media is labelled with <label spec> such that
                              it can be referenced by the `\movieref' command
                              somewhere else in the document.

   mimetype=<mimetype>        Mime type of media. Must be specified if
                              <media file> has a non-standard file name
                              extension from which the mimetype cannot be
                              guessed. See table `Known file name extensions'
                              below.

   mouse[=true|false]         Enable mouse interaction: Clicking onto the media
                              (giving it the focus) pauses the playback while
                              clicking outside resumes it. In 3D context this
                              option is set to `true' by default, but may be set
                              to `false' in order to make the 3D annotation
                              non-interactive.

   palindrome[=true|false]    Play media forward and backward.

   playerid=<playerid>        Forces a particular media player plug-in to be
                              used instead of the default one. Currently, the
                              following values are recognised:
                              AAPL_QuickTime, MACR_FlashPlayer, RNWK_RealPlayer,
                              MSFT_WindowsMediaPlayer, ADBE_MCI (Adobe builtin
                              player).

   poster                     The first frame of the movie or the frame at the
                              beginning of the movie section specified by the
                              `startat' and `endat' options is shown.

   poster=<image>             Insert still image from file to be shown when
                              media is not activated. The file type depends on
                              the output driver: PS or EPS when using latex
                              together with dvips; PDF, PNG or JPEG when using
                              pdflatex.

                              Deprecated. Use option `text' instead.

                              See option `text' for a possibility to scale the
                              media display area according to the poster image
                              dimensions.

   rate=<rate>                Playback rate (multiple of original speed).

   repeat[=<repeats>]         Number of repeats. Without argument -> repeat
                              forever.

   startat=<offset>           Start/stop playback at the specified offsets
   endat=<offset>             (time, frame, named marker). <offset> syntax:

                              time:<seconds>
                              frame:<frame number>
                              marker:<quoted string>
                              {marker:<quoted string>, time:<seconds>}
                              {marker:<quoted string>, frame:<frame number>}

   text=<text>                <text> is typeset onto the media display area.
                              <text> is centred horizontally and vertically.
                              If either or both of the <width> and <height>
                              arguments are left empty, any unspecified
                              dimension of the media clip is scaled to fit the
                              corresponding dimension, i. e. width or height, of
                              <text>. Likewise, the depth of the media display
                              is adjusted to the depth of <text> if the `depth'
                              option has not been given.

                              This option can be used to scale the media display
                              area to the natural or scaled dimensions of the
                              poster image, e. g.:

                              \includemovie[text={\includegraphics[scale=2]{
                                path/to/poster}}]{}{}{path/to/movie}

   textoverposter[=false]     Set this option to `false' if you wish <text> to
                              be obscured by the external poster image (if
                              specified). Deprecated.

   url                        Treat <media file> as URL. Sets option `inline'
                              to false automatically.

   volume=<volume>            Percentage of original volume.

   3Daac=<angle>              This option sets the aperture angle of the camera,
                              measured in degrees. Fixed point real numbers
                              between 0 and 180 are admissible. A sensible value
                              of 30 is pre-set by default. Larger values can be
                              used to achieve wide-angle or fish-eye effects.

   3Dc2c=<x> <y> <z>          Direction vector C2C of arbitrary length,
                              originating in the centre of orbit and pointing
                              to the virtual camera; cf. option `3Dcoo' for the
                              number format of <x> <y> <z>.

   3Dcoo=<x> <y> <z>          Positional vector COO of the centre of orbit.
                              Only fixed point numbers in the range from
                              -999999999999999999.999999999999999999 to
                              +999999999999999999.999999999999999999 are
                              allowed.

   3Droll=<roll>              Prescribes an initial camera roll around the
                              optical axis (in clockwise direction, if <roll>
                              is greater than zero); measured in degrees.

   3Droo=<r>                  Radius of orbit ROO of the virtual camera; cf.
                              option `3Dcoo' for the number format.

   3Dviews=<views file>       Further named, predefined views can be set in an
                              auxiliary file specified by the 3Dviews option.
                              The file <views file> contains lines which obey
                              the syntax:

[<name>]{<coo_x> <coo_y> <coo_z>}{<c2c_x> <c2c_y> <c2c_z>}{<roo>}{<roll>}{<aac>}

                              The <name> entry is optional. For <coo_x>,
                              <coo_y>, <coo_z>, <c2c_x>, <c2c_y>, <c2c_z>, <roo>
                              and <aac> the same rules as for the corresponding
                              options `3Dcoo', `3Dc2c', `3Droo' and `3Daac'
                              apply.

   3Dbg=<r> <g> <b>           This option sets the background colour of the
                              canvas. Only fixed point real numbers in the range
                              from 0 to 1 are allowed for the colour components.

   3Dlights=<lighting scheme> Sets the default lighting scheme. Possible values
                              are: `None', `White', `Day', `Night', `Hard',
                              `Primary', `Blue', `Red', `Cube', `CAD',
                              `HeadLamp'.

   3Drender=<render mode>     Sets the default render mode. Possible values
                              are: `Solid', `SolidWireframe', `Transparent',
                              `TransparentWireframe', `BoundingBox',
                              `TransparentBoundingBox',
                              `TransparentBoundingBoxOutline', `Wireframe',
                              `ShadedWireframe', `HiddenWireframe', `Vertices',
                              `ShadedVertices', `Illustration', `SolidOutline',
                              `ShadedIllustration'.

   3Djscript=<JavaScript file> Things like animation, lighting, background
                              colour etc. may also be script driven. Option
                              `3Djscript' associates a <JavaScript file> with
                              the 3D object. The script will be executed upon
                              activation of the object.

   3Dresource=<resource file 1>[, 3Dresource=<resource file 2> [, ...]]

                              Embeds additional 3D or rasterized image files for
                              use as resources in the 3D annotation. Possible
                              file types are U3D, Postscript (LaTeX + dvips) and
                              PDF/JPEG/PNG (pdfLaTeX). Embedded resources must
                              be loaded by the JavaScript method

                              Resource("pdf://<resource path>")

                              where <resource path> stands for the path to the
                              resource file as specified by the `3Dresource'
                              option.

 Additional options for use with `\movieref':

   play                       (Default) Immediately restarts playback. If new
                              playback settings have been specified through the
                              options given above, they override the original
                              settings being in effect during media inclusion.

   stop                       Stops and rewinds the media to its beginning or to
                              the `startat' position.

   resume                     Resumes paused media. In fact, this option makes
                              the hyperlink a toggle switch: repeated clicking
                              switches between paused and resumed state.

   pause                      Has the same effect as option `resume'. Added for
                              completeness only.

   close                      Immediately closes the media player.

   default                    Play the media at the original settings which were in
                              effect during media inclusion.

   3Dviewindex=<index>        Opens the first `F', last `L', next `N' or
                              previous `P' view from the list of additional
                              views, or the one indexed by an integer. `D' gives
                              access to the default view.

   3Dcalculate[=<aac angle>]  Creates a link for calculating `3Droo' and `3Dcoo'
                              settings of the virtual camera. The default
                              aperture angle of 30 degrees is used for the
                              calculation unless an optional <aac angle> has
                              been provided.

   3Dgetview                  Camera settings corresponding to the current view
                              in the Reader are printed to a dialogue box. The
                              output is readily formatted to be inserted into a
                              file of predefined views, see option `3Dviews'.

Requirements:

 package `fp', if option `3D' is selected

 pdfTeX, version >= 1.20 needed for PDF output

 Adobe Reader, version >=6 for playing movies/sound,
 Adobe Reader, version >=7 for 3D objects

 Embedded media file data can also be extracted and saved to disk from within
 Readers which support file attachments. This makes PDF documents a little more
 portable to Readers which do not ship with a multimedia plugin.


Installation:
